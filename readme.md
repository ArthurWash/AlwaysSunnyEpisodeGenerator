# Welcome!

This is my first website I created that implements HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional, dynamic website.

My friends and I love the show 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia'. When we want to watch a random episode, we had a system of picking a number from 1-15 (the seasons) and a number depending on how many episodes are in that season.
I found this to be a little difficult if you didn't know every single number of episodes for each season. So with a Web Development degree almost complete, why not design a web app to do this for us?

You can use this website to generate a random episode from the show 'It's Always Sunny in Philedalphia' to watch. Each time the 'Generate!' button is pressed, the program will choose a random episode for you, and provide the
season, episode, title, and description.

The background image used is owned by FX and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.

# Version 1
The first version has my web app working properly. I only added seasons one and two to have data to work with. I will be updating with each season as I add them (it takes time and is very tedious!)
