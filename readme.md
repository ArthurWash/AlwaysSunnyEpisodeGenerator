# Welcome!

This is my first website I created that implements HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional, dynamic website.

My friends and I love the show 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia'. When we want to watch a random episode, we had a system of picking a number from 1-15 (the seasons) and a number depending on how many episodes are in that season.
I found this to be a little difficult if you didn't know every single number of episodes for each season. So with a Web Development degree almost complete, why not design a web app to do this for us?

You can use this website to generate a random episode from the show 'It's Always Sunny in Philedalphia' to watch. Each time the 'Generate!' button is pressed, the program will choose a random episode for you, and provide the
season, episode, title, and description.

The background image used is owned by FX and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.

# Version 1.0
The first version has my web app working properly. I only added seasons one and two to have data to work with. I will be updating with each season as I add them (it takes time and is very tedious!)

# Version 2.0
In version 2.0, I decided to change course and access the episode data from an API instead of entering it manually. This future proofs the webapp, as when new episodes release the API will automatically update the data for me. 

Special thanks to tvmaze.com/api for making this data public and easy to use!

Lastly, I do not own IASIP. It along with the background image used are owned by FXX.

# Version 2.1
Fixes a font error, where the font intended was not loading properly.
